<strong><center><p><font size=5><font color=red>As a child I lived in Brooklyn, NY but came to Schenectady, NY when I was 7. I am now in 7th grade and go to Mont Pleasant Middle School. I enjoy reading Harry Potter books and learn new things. I am sorted into the Ravenclaw House. My lifelong goal is to become a cardiovascular surgeon. My greatest achievement was getting into the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp @ Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I was one of 36 students chosen from 20 regions. A lot of students applied and was accepted. I am also in the Science Technology Entry Program (STEP) @ Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I implement technology in everyday use. We are currently building a futuristic city that will benefit senior citizens.
